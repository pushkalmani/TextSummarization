      "Various scientists, politicians and news media have adopted the terms climate crisis or a climate emergency to talk about climate change, while using global heating instead of global warming.\n",
      "[citation needed] Both the terms global warming and climate change were used only occasionally until 1975, when Wallace Smith Broecker published a scientific paper on the topic, \"Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?\".\n",
      "Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that, during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 째C (0.5 to 3.1 째F) in a moderate scenario, or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 째C (4.7 to 8.6 째F) in an extreme scenario, depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects.\n",
      "TAR Working Group II Report TAR Working Group III Report AR4 Working Group I Report AR4 Working Group II Report AR4 Working Group III Report AR4 Synthesis Report AR5 Working Group I Report AR5 Working Group II Report AR5 Working Group III Report AR5 Synthesis Report Special Report: SR15 Special Report: Climate change and Land Special Report: SROCC\n",
      "The term climate change is also used to refer to past and future climate changes that persist for an extended period of time, and includes regional changes as well as global change.\n",
      "Although the most common measure of global warming is the increase in the near-surface atmospheric temperature, over 90% of the additional energy in the climate system over the last 50 years has been stored in the ocean, warming it.\n",
      "Mitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, forest preservation, as well as the development of potential climate engineering technologies.\n",
      "There are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimize the negative impacts of climate change.\n",
      "This phrase next appeared in a November 1957 report in The Hammond Times which described Roger Revelle's research into the effects of increasing human-caused CO2 emissions on the greenhouse effect: \"a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result\".\n",
      "Climate change impacts can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by enhancing the capacity of Earth's land surface to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n"
